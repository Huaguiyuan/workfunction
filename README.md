Workfunction
============

A Fortran program to calculate a planar averaged electrostatic potential from a 3D potential grid for the density functional theory code VASP. It can be used to compute the workfunction (or ionisation potential) for a material surface or as an alignment technique for comparing the electronic eigenvalues of different systems.
